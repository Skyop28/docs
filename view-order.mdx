After placing an order, you can track its progress through your dashboard. This page explains how to access order details and understand the information displayed.

## Finding your order

There are several ways to access your order details:

**From the confirmation page**: After completing payment, the confirmation page displays your order details and delivery status. Bookmark this page or note the order reference number for future access.

**From the dashboard**: Navigate to **Orders** in the sidebar to see all your orders. Click any order to view its details.

**From email**: Order confirmation emails include a link to view your order details directly.

**Using the order reference**: If you have your order reference number (formatted as `ORD-XXXXXXXXXX`), you can search for it in the Orders section.
