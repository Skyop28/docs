  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Complete payment in your UPI app">
    You have two options:
    
    **Option A: Scan QR code**
    1. Open your UPI app
    2. Select the scan or QR code option
    3. Scan the QR code displayed on the payment page
    4. Verify the amount and recipient
    5. Enter your UPI PIN to authorize
    
    **Option B: Use UPI ID**
    1. Open your UPI app
    2. Select send money or pay
    3. Enter the UPI ID shown on the payment page
    4. Enter the exact amount displayed
    5. Enter your UPI PIN to authorize
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Wait for confirmation">
    After authorizing the payment in your UPI app, the Right Spot payment page automatically detects the transaction. This typically takes 10-30 seconds.
    
    Do not close the payment page until confirmation appears.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="View order confirmation">
    Once payment is confirmed, you are redirected to the order confirmation page showing delivery status.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Payment amount

When paying via UPI, ensure you send the exact amount displayed on the payment page. The amount is in Indian Rupees (INR).

<Warning>
Sending an incorrect amount may delay order processing. If you accidentally send the wrong amount, contact support immediately with your UPI transaction reference.
</Warning>

## Processing time

UPI payments are processed in real-time. Once you authorize the payment in your UPI app, confirmation typically appears on the Right Spot page within 30 seconds.

If confirmation takes longer than 2 minutes, the payment may have failed. Check your UPI app transaction history to verify whether the payment was deducted.

## Transaction limits

UPI transaction limits are set by your bank and UPI app. Common limits include:

- Per-transaction limit (typically ₹1,00,000)
- Daily limit (varies by bank)
- Monthly limit (varies by bank)

If your order exceeds your UPI limit, consider:
- Splitting into multiple smaller orders
- Using a different payment method
- Checking with your bank about increasing limits

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="QR code not scanning">
    Ensure your camera has permission to scan QR codes. Try adjusting lighting or distance. If scanning fails, use the UPI ID method instead.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Payment deducted but order shows pending">
    Wait up to 5 minutes for the payment notification to reach our system. If the order still shows pending, contact support with:
    - Your UPI transaction reference number
    - Screenshot of the successful payment from your UPI app
    - Your Right Spot order reference
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="UPI PIN declined">
    Verify you are entering the correct UPI PIN. If you have forgotten your PIN, reset it through your UPI app before attempting payment again.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Bank server unavailable">
    UPI depends on bank servers which occasionally experience downtime. Wait a few minutes and try again, or use a different payment method.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Payment timed out">
    The payment page has a time limit. If the page expired, return to your dashboard and start the payment process again. Any incomplete payment is not charged.
  </Accordion>

Refunds for UPI payments are returned to the original bank account. Processing typically completes within 3-5 business days, though some refunds may appear faster.
