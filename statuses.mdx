description: "Understand the meaning of each order status"
---

Orders progress through several statuses from placement to completion. This page explains what each status means.

## Order statuses

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| Processing | Order is being processed |
| Delivered (Complete) | Order fully delivered |
| Delayed | Delivery has been delayed |
| Partially Delivered | Part of your order has been delivered |
| Failed / Cancelled | Order could not be completed |

---

## Normal progression

A successful order follows this path:

```
Order Placed → Processing → Completed
```

The progress bar on your order page shows these three stages: **Placed → Processing → Delivered**.

For instant orders, this usually completes within seconds. For pre-orders, processing begins when stock is available.

## Status descriptions

### Processing

Your order is being fulfilled. For instant orders, this is brief. For pre-orders, this may take longer depending on your position in the queue, often a few days.

### Delivered (Complete)

Your order is completed. All Pokecoins have been delivered to your market ID.

### Delayed

Your order delivery has been delayed. The tracking timeline shows the new expected delivery date.

You will receive an email notification when an order is delayed.

### Partially Delivered

Part of your order has been delivered. This can happen with large pre-orders that are fulfilled in batches.

The tracking timeline shows:
- Amount delivered so far
- Remaining amount

### Failed / Cancelled

The order could not be completed. Check the tracking timeline for the reason.

Contact support if you need assistance.

## Tracking timeline

Each order has a tracking timeline that shows all status updates with timestamps and messages. Special updates like partial deliveries and delays include additional information:

- **Partial delivery**: Shows amount delivered vs total
- **Delay**: Shows new expected delivery date
