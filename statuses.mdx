## Detailed status descriptions

### Pending Payment

Your order has been created but payment has not been received. This status appears when:

- You started checkout but did not complete payment
- You selected a payment method but closed the payment page
- Payment is awaiting confirmation from the provider

**What to do**: Return to your dashboard and complete the payment process. Orders in this status expire after 30 minutes if payment is not received.

### Payment Processing

Your payment has been initiated and is being verified. This is a transitional status that typically lasts only a few seconds for most payment methods.

For some payment methods, this status may persist longer:

- **Crypto payments**: Waiting for blockchain confirmations
- **Bank transfers**: Waiting for bank verification
- **Manual verification**: Rare cases requiring additional checks

**What to do**: Wait for the payment to be verified. Do not submit another payment while this status is active.

### Payment Confirmed

Your payment has been received and verified. The order will now proceed to processing.

This status confirms:
- Funds have been received
- Payment amount matches the order total
- No issues were detected with the transaction

**What to do**: No action required. The order will progress to processing automatically.

### Processing

Your order is being prepared for delivery. During this phase:

- The system verifies your market ID
- Pokecoins are allocated from inventory
- The delivery transaction is prepared

For instant orders, processing typically completes within seconds. For pre-orders, processing begins when stock becomes available.

**What to do**: Wait for delivery to complete. Monitor the order page for updates.

### Delivering

The delivery transaction is in progress. Your Pokecoins are being sent to your market ID through the Poketwo system.

This status is brief for most orders, lasting only the time needed to execute the market transaction.

**What to do**: Wait for delivery confirmation. Do not attempt to place another order for the same market ID until this delivery completes.

### Delivered

Your order is complete. The Pokecoins have been successfully sent to your market ID.

The order details page shows:
- Delivery timestamp
- Confirmation from the Poketwo system
- Final order summary

**What to do**: Verify the Pokecoins in your Poketwo market using `@Poketwo market info`. If the balance is incorrect, contact support.

<Check>
A delivered status means the transaction was successfully executed. Your Pokecoins should be available in your market immediately.
</Check>

### Failed

An error prevented the order from completing. Common causes include:

- Invalid market ID
- Poketwo system unavailable
- Delivery transaction rejected

The order details page displays the specific reason for failure.

**What to do**: Review the failure reason. Depending on the cause, you may be able to retry the order or you may need to contact support. Failed orders that cannot be retried are eligible for refund.

### Canceled

The order was canceled before completion. Cancellation can occur:

- By your request (before payment)
- Automatically (payment timeout)
- By the system (detected issues)

**What to do**: If you still want to purchase Pokecoins, place a new order. Refunds for canceled orders are processed according to the refund policy.

## Status progression

A typical successful order follows this progression:

```
Pending Payment → Payment Processing → Payment Confirmed → Processing → Delivering → Delivered
```

Each transition triggers a notification and updates the order timeline.

## Troubleshooting stuck orders

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Order stuck on Pending Payment">
    The payment was not received. Either complete the payment from your dashboard or allow the order to expire and place a new order.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Order stuck on Payment Processing">
    For card and PayPal payments, this usually resolves within minutes. For crypto, wait for the required blockchain confirmations. If the status persists beyond 30 minutes, contact support with your transaction receipt.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Order stuck on Processing">
