### Understanding the pricing display

As you adjust the quantity, the price updates in real-time. The display shows:

- Price per million Pokecoins at your selected quantity
- Total cost for your order

<Note>
Bulk discounts are applied automatically as you increase the quantity. The discount percentage is displayed so you can see exactly how much you are saving.

## Troubleshooting
