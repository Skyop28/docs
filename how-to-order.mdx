This guide walks you through the complete process of purchasing Pokecoins, from selecting your quantity to receiving delivery confirmation.

## Before you begin

Make sure you have:

- A Right Spot account (sign in with Discord)
- Your Poketwo market ID ready
- A valid payment method

If you do not know your market ID, instructions are provided in Step 2 below.

## Order process overview

The ordering process consists of six steps:

1. Select quantity
2. Enter market ID
3. Review order summary
4. Choose payment method
5. Complete payment
6. Receive confirmation

<Steps>
  <Step title="Select quantity">
    Navigate to the purchase page by clicking **Buy Pokecoins** in the navigation bar or from your dashboard.
    
    [IMAGE PLACEHOLDER: Quantity selection interface]
    
    The quantity selector allows you to specify how many Pokecoins you want to purchase. You can:
    
    - Use the slider to adjust the amount
    - Enter a specific number directly
    - Select from preset amounts for quick ordering
    
    As you adjust the quantity, the price updates in real-time. The display shows:
    
    - Price per million Pokecoins at your selected quantity
    - Total cost before payment processing
    - Any bulk discounts applied to your order
    
    <Note>
    Bulk discounts are applied automatically. Larger orders receive better per-unit pricing—you can see the discount percentage displayed as you increase quantity.
    </Note>
    
    The page also displays current stock availability. If your requested amount exceeds available stock, the order becomes a [pre-order](/ordering/pre-orders).
    
    Click **Continue** when you have selected your desired quantity.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Enter market ID">
    Your market ID is how Pokecoins are delivered to your Poketwo account. This step ensures the delivery goes to the correct destination.

    ### Finding your market ID
    
    To find your market ID in Discord:
    
    1. Open a server where Poketwo is active
    2. Type `@Poketwo market info` or use the slash command `/market info`
    3. Poketwo responds with your market information, including your market ID
    4. Copy the 8-character market ID
    
    ### Entering your market ID
    
    Paste or type your market ID into the input field. The system validates the format automatically.
    
    <Warning>
    Double-check your market ID before proceeding. Pokecoins sent to an incorrect market ID cannot be recovered. If you are unsure, verify the ID in Poketwo before continuing.
    </Warning>
    
    Click **Continue** after entering a valid market ID.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Review order summary">
    The summary page displays all details of your order for final review before payment.
    
    [IMAGE PLACEHOLDER: Order summary screen]
    
    Review the following information:
    
    **Order details**
    - Pokecoin amount
    - Price per million
    - Total cost
    - Any discounts applied
    
    **Delivery information**
    - Market ID where Pokecoins will be delivered
    - Order type (instant or pre-order)
    - Expected delivery time
    
    This is your last opportunity to make changes before payment. Use the back button to modify quantity or market ID if needed.
    
    Click **Continue** to proceed to payment method selection.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Choose payment method">
    Select how you want to pay for your order. Available payment methods include:

    Select your preferred method and click **Continue** to proceed to the payment page.

  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Complete payment">
    The payment page displays instructions specific to your selected payment method.
    
    [IMAGE PLACEHOLDER: Payment completion screen]
    
    **For PayPal**: You are redirected to PayPal to authorize the payment. After authorization, you return to Right Spot automatically.
    
    **For Cards**: Enter your card details in the secure payment form. Your card information is processed by Stripe and never touches Right Spot servers.
    
    **For UPI**: Scan the QR code or use the UPI ID to pay through your UPI app. Payment confirmation is detected automatically.
    
    **For Crypto**: Send the exact amount to the provided wallet address. The page displays a QR code and address for your convenience.
    
    <Warning>
    Do not close the payment page until you see confirmation. For crypto payments, ensure you send the exact amount specified—partial payments may not be credited automatically.
    </Warning>
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Receive confirmation">
    After successful payment, you are redirected to the confirmation page.
    
    [IMAGE PLACEHOLDER: Order confirmation screen]
    
    The confirmation page displays:
    
    - Order reference number
    - Payment confirmation
    - Delivery status
    - Expected delivery time (for instant orders, this shows "Delivered" immediately in most cases)
    
    For instant orders, delivery typically occurs within seconds. The confirmation page updates automatically when delivery completes.
    
    You also receive:
    
    - An email confirmation with order details
    - A dashboard notification
    - The order appears in your Orders list
    
    <Check>
    Your order is complete. Check your Poketwo market to verify receipt of your Pokecoins.
    </Check>
  </Step>
</Steps>

## After placing your order

Once your order is confirmed, you can:

- Track delivery status in [your dashboard](/dashboard/orders)
- View the order timeline for detailed event history
- Contact support if you experience any issues

For instant orders, verify your Poketwo market shows the new balance. For pre-orders, monitor the delivery progress in your dashboard.

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Payment was completed but order shows pending">
    Some payment methods have delayed confirmation. Wait a few minutes and refresh your dashboard. If the status does not update within 30 minutes, contact support with your payment receipt.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Order delivered but Pokecoins not in market">
    Delivery confirmation means the transaction was sent to Poketwo. Check your market using `@Poketwo market info`. If the balance is incorrect, contact support with your order reference number.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Payment page expired or closed accidentally">
    Return to your dashboard and find the order under pending orders. You can resume payment from there. If the order does not appear, start a new order.
  </Accordion>
