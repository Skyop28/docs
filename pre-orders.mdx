Pre-orders allow you to purchase Pokecoins when the requested amount exceeds our current available stock. This page explains how pre-orders differ from instant orders and what to expect when placing one.

## When pre-orders apply

Pre-orders are automatically triggered when your requested Pokecoin amount exceeds our current stock levels. You do not need to select pre-order manually—the system determines the order type based on availability at the time of purchase.

<Warning>
Pre-orders have longer delivery times compared to instant orders. If you need Pokecoins immediately, check the current stock on the purchase page and order within the available amount for instant delivery.
</Warning>

## How pre-orders work

When you place a pre-order:

1. Your payment is processed immediately, just like an instant order
2. Your order enters a queue based on the order timestamp
3. As stock becomes available, orders are fulfilled in the order they were placed
4. You receive a notification when your delivery is complete

## Delivery timeline

Pre-order delivery depends on stock replenishment schedules. While instant orders are delivered within seconds, pre-orders may take:

- **Small amounts over stock**: Usually delivered within 24-48 hours
- **Large amounts**: May be delivered in multiple batches over several days

Your order details page shows the expected delivery window and updates as your position in the queue advances.

## Partial deliveries

For large pre-orders, delivery may occur in stages. This means you receive portions of your order as stock becomes available, rather than waiting for the full amount to be ready.

Each partial delivery:

- Triggers a notification
- Updates your order status with the amount delivered
- Shows remaining balance yet to be delivered

Your order is marked complete only when the full amount has been delivered.

## Tracking pre-orders

Pre-orders appear in your [Orders](/dashboard/orders) section with a "Pre-order" label. The order details page includes:

- Queue position (if applicable)
- Expected delivery window
- Delivery progress for partial deliveries
- Timeline of all delivery events

## Canceling a pre-order

Pre-orders cannot be canceled once payment is confirmed, as stock is reserved for your order. If you need to cancel, contact support as soon as possible. Cancellation may be possible before stock allocation begins, subject to our refund policy.

## Pricing for pre-orders

Pre-orders use the same pricing as instant orders. The price per million Pokecoins is locked at the time you place the order, regardless of any price changes that occur before delivery.

## Avoiding pre-orders

If you prefer instant delivery, you can avoid pre-orders by:

- Checking the available stock displayed on the purchase page
- Ordering within the available amount
- Placing multiple smaller orders over time if you need more than current stock
