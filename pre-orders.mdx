Pre-orders let you purchase Pokecoins when we are temporarily out of stock or when your order exceeds our current inventory.

## When you see the pre-order screen

If you select a quantity that exceeds our current stock, you will see a "Temporarily Out of Stock" screen. This screen shows:

- The estimated delivery date
- The expected wait time in days

Click "Start Pre-Order" to continue with your purchase.

## How delivery dates are calculated

We have a daily delivery capacity for pre-orders. The system calculates your expected delivery date based on:

- Your order quantity
- Current pending pre-orders ahead of you
- Our daily fulfillment capacity

The estimated date updates in real-time as you change your order quantity.

## Pre-order vs instant order

| | Instant Order | Pre-Order |
|---|---|---|
| Stock requirement | Within available stock | Exceeds available stock |
| Delivery | Within minutes | Estimated date shown |
| Pricing | Standard pricing | Same as instant |
| Payment | Immediate | Immediate |

## After placing a pre-order

Once you complete payment:

1. Your order is confirmed and queued
2. You receive a confirmation email with the expected delivery date
3. You can track your order in the [Orders](/dashboard/orders) section
4. You receive an email when delivery is complete

Pre-orders are labeled "PRE-ORDER" in your order history.

## Pricing

Pre-orders use the same pricing and pack discounts as instant orders. Your price is locked when you place the order.
