Pre-orders let you place an order when we are temporarily out of stock. Your order is queued and delivered once stock is replenished.

## When pre-orders are triggered

You enter pre-order mode when:

- **Stock is 0**: You see "Temporarily Out of Stock" immediately when visiting the purchase page
- **Your quantity exceeds stock**: After entering an amount larger than current stock

In both cases, click "Start Pre-Order" to continue.

## Pre-order mode

Once you click "Start Pre-Order," the purchase page changes:

- Purple theme instead of blue
- "PRE-ORDER MODE" badge displayed
- A delivery estimate panel appears

## Delivery estimate

The delivery estimate panel shows:

- **Expected delivery date**: When your order should be completed
- **Wait time**: Approximate number of days

This estimate updates in real-time as you change your quantity.
