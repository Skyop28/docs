## Choosing a payment method

Consider these factors when selecting how to pay:

**Speed**: Card payments and PayPal typically process instantly. UPI processes within seconds. Cryptocurrency requires blockchain confirmations, which can take several minutes.

**Availability**: PayPal and cards are available globally. UPI is limited to India. Cryptocurrency is available anywhere but requires a crypto wallet.

**Fees**: Payment processing fees vary by method. The checkout page displays the final amount including any applicable fees before you confirm payment.

## Payment security

- **PayPal**: Processed directly through PayPal
- **Cards**: Processed through PayPal
