Transparency about data collection is important. This page explains exactly what information Right Spot collects, where it comes from, and why we need it.

## Information collected during account creation

When you sign in with Discord, we receive the following information from Discord:

**Discord username**: Your public Discord username, used to identify your account and display in your dashboard.

**Discord user ID**: A unique numeric identifier assigned by Discord. This helps us maintain your account even if you change your username.

**Email address**: The email associated with your Discord account. Used for order confirmations, delivery notifications, and support communications.

**Profile picture**: Your Discord avatar, displayed in your dashboard for personalization.

<Note>
We only receive this basic profile information. We do not have access to your Discord messages, servers, friends list, or any private information.
