- **Order placed**: Confirmation that your order was received
- **Payment confirmed**: Your payment has been processed successfully
- **Processing started**: Your order is being prepared for delivery
- **Delivered**: Your Pokecoins have been sent to your market ID
- **Delivery failed**: An issue occurred during delivery (includes next steps)

### Payment notifications

Information about payment events:

- **Payment received**: Funds have been received and verified
- **Payment pending**: Waiting for payment confirmation (common with some payment methods)
- **Payment expired**: A pending payment was not completed within the time limit

## Reading notifications

Click any notification to view its full details. For order-related notifications, clicking will navigate you to the relevant order details page.

Notifications are marked as read once you view them. The unread count in the sidebar updates automatically.

## Notification history

Your notification feed retains notifications for 90 days. Older notifications are automatically removed from the feed but do not affect your order history or account records.

## Managing notifications

### Marking as read

You can mark all notifications as read using the option at the top of the notification feed. This clears the unread count without needing to click each notification individually.

### Filtering

Filter your notification feed to show specific types:

- **All**: Every notification
- **Orders**: Only order-related updates
- **Payments**: Only payment-related updates
- **Unread**: Only notifications you have not viewed

## Email notifications

In addition to dashboard notifications, you receive email notifications for important events. Configure your email notification preferences in [Settings](/dashboard/settings).

Email notifications include:

- Order confirmation with order details
- Payment confirmation with receipt information
- Delivery confirmation with timestamp

<Note>
Transactional emails (order confirmations, delivery notifications) are sent regardless of promotional email preferences. These are essential communications about your purchases.
