## Choosing a payment method

**Availability**: PayPal and cards are available globally. UPI is limited to India. Cryptocurrency is available anywhere but requires a crypto wallet.

**Fees**: Payment processing fees vary by method. The checkout page displays the final amount including any applicable fees before you confirm payment.

All payment processing is handled by established, trusted providers:

- **PayPal**: Processed directly through PayPal
- **Cards**: Processed through Stripe
- **UPI**: Processed through Cashfree
