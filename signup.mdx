Right Spot uses Discord for authentication. This means you do not need to create a separate username and password. Instead, you sign in with your existing Discord account.

## Creating your account

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to the sign-in page">
    Click the **Sign In** button in the top navigation bar, or go directly to the authentication page from the homepage.
    
    [IMAGE PLACEHOLDER: Homepage with Sign In button highlighted]
  </Step>
  <Step title="Authorize with Discord">
    You will be redirected to Discord's official authorization page. This page shows what information Right Spot is requesting access to.
    
    Review the permissions and click **Authorize** to continue.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Complete registration">
    After authorization, you will be redirected back to Right Spot. Your account is now created and you can access your dashboard.

</Steps>

## What information we receive

When you authorize Right Spot, Discord shares only basic profile information:

- Your Discord username
- Your Discord user ID
- Your email address (for order confirmations)
- Your profile picture

We do not receive access to your Discord messages, servers, friends list, or any private information.

<Note>
Concerned about authorizing Discord? Read [Why we require Discord](/getting-started/why-discord) for a detailed explanation of how OAuth works and why your account remains completely secure.
</Note>

## Logging in to an existing account

If you already have a Right Spot account, the login process is identical to signing up. Click **Sign In**, authorize with Discord, and you will be taken to your dashboard with access to your order history and account settings.

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Discord authorization failed">
    If the authorization fails, ensure you are logged into the correct Discord account in your browser. Try logging out of Discord and back in, then attempt the authorization again.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Redirected to wrong account">
    If you have multiple Discord accounts and signed into the wrong one, log out of Right Spot, clear your browser cookies for Discord, and sign in again with the correct Discord account.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Email not receiving confirmations">
    Ensure the email associated with your Discord account is correct and check your spam folder. You can update your Discord email in Discord's user settings.
