Right Spot uses Discord for authentication. This means you do not need to create a separate username and password. Instead, you sign in with your existing Discord account.

## Creating your account

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to the sign-in page">
    Click the **Sign In** button in the top navigation bar, or go directly to the authentication page from the homepage.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Authorize with Discord">
    You will be redirected to Discord's authorization page. Review the permissions requested and click **Authorize** to continue.

  <Step title="Complete registration">
    After authorization, you will be redirected back to Right Spot. Your account is now created and you can access your dashboard.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Why we use Discord authentication

There are several reasons we chose Discord as our authentication method:

**Direct connection to your gaming identity**: Since Poketwo operates within Discord, authenticating with Discord ensures we can associate your purchases with the correct account. This helps with order verification and customer support.

**No additional passwords to remember**: You already have a Discord account if you use Poketwo. Using Discord login means one less password to manage and no risk of forgetting credentials for yet another service.

**Enhanced security**: Discord handles the authentication process, including two-factor authentication if you have it enabled on your Discord account. This means your login security benefits from Discord's infrastructure.

**Faster support resolution**: When you contact support, we can quickly verify your identity and locate your orders using your Discord information. This speeds up the resolution process for any issues.

## What information we receive

When you authorize Right Spot to access your Discord account, we receive:

- Your Discord username and discriminator
- Your Discord user ID
- Your email address (used for order confirmations and support)
- Your profile picture (displayed in your dashboard)

We do not receive access to your Discord messages, servers, or any other private information. The authorization is limited to basic profile information only.

## Logging in to an existing account

If you already have a Right Spot account, the login process is identical to signing up. Click **Sign In**, authorize with Discord, and you will be taken to your dashboard with access to your order history and account settings.

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Discord authorization failed">
    If the authorization fails, ensure you are logged into the correct Discord account in your browser. Try logging out of Discord and back in, then attempt the authorization again.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Redirected to wrong account">
    If you have multiple Discord accounts and signed into the wrong one, log out of Right Spot, clear your browser cookies for Discord, and sign in again with the correct Discord account.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Email not receiving confirmations">
    Ensure the email associated with your Discord account is correct and check your spam folder. You can update your Discord email in Discord's user settings.
