  <Step title="View payment details">
    The payment page displays:

  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Send the payment">
    From your cryptocurrency wallet:
    
    1. Copy the wallet address or scan the QR code
    2. Enter the exact amount displayed
    3. Send the transaction
    
    <Warning>
    Send the exact amount shown. The amount is calculated at the current exchange rate and is only valid for the duration of the payment window. Sending a different amount may result in processing delays.
    </Warning>
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Wait for confirmations">
    After sending, the payment page tracks the transaction status:
    
    - **Detecting**: Waiting for the transaction to appear on the blockchain
    - **Confirming**: Transaction detected, waiting for required confirmations
    - **Confirmed**: Payment complete, order processing
    
    The number of required confirmations depends on the cryptocurrency:
    - Bitcoin: 1 confirmation (approximately 10-60 minutes)
    - Litecoin: 3 confirmations (approximately 7-15 minutes)
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="View order confirmation">
    Once the required confirmations are received, you are redirected to the order confirmation page.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Understanding confirmations

Blockchain transactions require confirmations before being considered final. Each confirmation represents a new block added to the blockchain after your transaction.

**Why confirmations matter**: Confirmations protect against double-spending and ensure the transaction cannot be reversed. More confirmations mean higher certainty that the payment is permanent.

**Confirmation times**: The time for confirmations varies based on:
- Network congestion
- Transaction fees you paid
- Block times for the specific cryptocurrency

During high network congestion, confirmation times may be longer than usual.

## Payment window

Cryptocurrency payments have a time-limited payment window, typically 30-60 minutes. This window exists because:

- Cryptocurrency prices fluctuate constantly
- The payment amount is calculated at a specific exchange rate
- Holding that rate indefinitely would create pricing discrepancies

If the payment window expires before you send the transaction, you need to start a new order. The new order will have updated pricing based on current exchange rates.

## Transaction fees

When sending cryptocurrency, you pay a network transaction fee to miners/validators. This fee is separate from your order total and is paid directly to the blockchain network.

Higher transaction fees typically result in faster confirmation times. If you need quick confirmation, consider using a higher fee setting in your wallet.

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Transaction sent but not detected">
    Transactions may take several minutes to appear on the blockchain depending on network conditions. If the payment page does not detect your transaction within 15 minutes, contact support with:
    - Your transaction hash/ID
    - The wallet address you sent to
    - Your Right Spot order reference
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Sent wrong amount">
    If you sent less than the required amount, the payment will not be processed automatically. Contact support with your transaction details to resolve the discrepancy.
    
    If you sent more than required, the excess amount is typically refunded after manual review.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Payment window expired">
    If your transaction was sent before the window expired but confirmations completed after, the payment should still be credited. If not, contact support with your transaction hash.
    
    If you did not send before the window expired, start a new order.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Confirmations taking too long">
    Low transaction fees can result in slow confirmations during network congestion. Options include:
    - Wait for the transaction to eventually confirm
    - Use a wallet that supports fee bumping (RBF for Bitcoin)
    - Contact support if the delay is causing issues with your order
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Sent to wrong address">
    If you sent cryptocurrency to an address other than the one displayed for your order, the payment cannot be recovered. Always verify the address before sending.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Refunds

Refunds for cryptocurrency payments are returned in the original cryptocurrency to a wallet address you provide. Contact support to initiate a refund and provide your receiving wallet address.

Refund amounts are based on the original cryptocurrency amount, not the fiat value at the time of refund. Cryptocurrency price changes between purchase and refund are your responsibility.
