    Click **Pay** to process your card. The page displays a processing indicator while the transaction is verified.

  <Step title="Complete verification if required">
    Some cards require additional verification through 3D Secure (Verified by Visa, Mastercard SecureCode, etc.). If prompted, complete the verification step with your bank.

## Card security

Your card information is handled entirely by Stripe. When you enter your card details:

1. The information is encrypted in your browser
2. Sent directly to Stripe's secure servers
3. Verified and processed by Stripe
4. Right Spot receives only confirmation of payment

**Right Spot never has access to your full card number, expiration date, or CVC.** We receive only a token that represents the transaction, not your actual card details.

See [Payment security](/security/payment-security) for more information about how your financial data is protected.

## Processing time

Card payments typically process within seconds. You see the result immediately after clicking Pay (or after completing 3D Secure verification if required).

## Why cards may be declined

Cards can be declined for several reasons:

**Insufficient funds**: The card does not have enough available credit or balance.

**Fraud prevention**: Your bank flagged the transaction as potentially fraudulent. This is common for first-time purchases from new merchants.

**Card restrictions**: Some cards have restrictions on online purchases or international transactions.

**Incorrect details**: The card number, expiration date, or CVC was entered incorrectly.

**Card expired**: The card has passed its expiration date.

### If your card is declined

1. Verify all card details are entered correctly
2. Check with your bank if there are any holds or restrictions
3. Try a different card
4. Use an alternative payment method

## 3D Secure

3D Secure is an additional security layer that some banks require. When triggered, you are asked to verify the transaction through your bank's authentication system.

This may involve:
- Entering a one-time code sent to your phone
- Confirming through your banking app
- Answering security questions

If 3D Secure verification fails, the payment is not processed. You can retry or use a different payment method.

## Saved cards

Right Spot does not store your card details. Each payment requires entering your card information. This is a security measure—since we never store card data, it cannot be compromised even in the unlikely event of a security breach.

## Refunds

Refunds for card payments are returned to the original card. Processing time varies by bank but typically takes 5-10 business days to appear on your statement.
