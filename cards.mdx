## Why cards are processed through PayPal

All card payments on Right Spot are processed through PayPal's payment gateway. This provides several benefits:

**Established security**: PayPal has processed payments for over two decades and handles billions of dollars in transactions. Their security infrastructure is world-class.

**No card data on our servers**: Your card information is entered directly on PayPal's website, not on Right Spot. We never see, handle, or store your card details.

**Buyer protection**: PayPal offers buyer protection programs that can help resolve disputes if issues arise.

**Wide card acceptance**: PayPal accepts cards from most countries and handles currency conversion automatically.

## Card security

When you enter your card details on PayPal's checkout page:

1. You are on PayPal's secure website (check the URL shows paypal.com)
2. Your card information is encrypted and sent directly to PayPal
3. PayPal processes the payment with your card issuer
4. Right Spot receives only a confirmation that payment was successful

**Right Spot never receives your card number, expiration date, or security code.** We only receive a transaction ID confirming the payment was completed.

See [Payment security](/security/payment-security) for detailed information about how your financial data is protected.

## Processing time

Card payments through PayPal typically process within seconds. You see the result immediately after confirming payment on PayPal's page.

## Why cards may be declined

Cards can be declined for several reasons:

**Insufficient funds**: The card does not have enough available credit or balance.

**Bank restrictions**: Your bank may block transactions to PayPal or international transactions.

**Incorrect details**: The card number, expiration date, or security code was entered incorrectly.

**Card not supported**: Some card types or issuers may not be accepted by PayPal in certain regions.

**Fraud prevention**: The bank flagged the transaction as potentially fraudulent.

### If your card is declined

1. Verify all card details are entered correctly
2. Check with your bank if there are any holds or restrictions on your card
3. Try a different card
4. Use an alternative payment method such as PayPal balance or UPI

## Refunds

Refunds for card payments made through PayPal are returned to the original card. Processing time varies by bank but typically takes 5-10 business days to appear on your statement.
